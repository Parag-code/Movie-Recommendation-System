# Movie-Recommendation-System

## Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict and suggest movies to users based on their preferences and metadata from a dataset. This system leverages similarity measures to provide personalized recommendations, ensuring an enhanced user experience.

## Features
- Suggests movies based on user preferences.
- Analyzes movie metadata to identify patterns and similarities.
- Utilizes popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning.
- Visualizes data insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Dataset
This project uses the `Movies Recommendation.csv` dataset. The dataset contains metadata about movies, including information like titles, genres, and other relevant features.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: 
   - The dataset is read using pandas.
   - Ensures the data is correctly loaded for further processing.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing or inconsistent data.
   - Formats data to make it suitable for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracts critical attributes like genres, keywords, or actors.
   - Transforms text data into numerical features using vectorization techniques like CountVectorizer.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Computes cosine similarity scores to find movies similar to a given input.
   - Sorts and ranks movies based on similarity scores to generate recommendations.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Generates plots to showcase genre distributions or similarity relationships.
   - Provides insights into recommendation logic through graphical representations.
