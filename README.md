# Movie-Recommendation-System

Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict and suggest movies to users based on their preferences and metadata from a dataset. This system leverages similarity measures to provide personalized recommendations, ensuring an enhanced user experience.

Features

Suggests movies based on user preferences.

Analyzes movie metadata to identify patterns and similarities.

Utilizes popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning.

Visualizes data insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

Dataset

This project uses the Movies Recommendation.csv dataset. The dataset contains metadata about movies, including information like titles, genres, and other relevant features.

How It Works

Data Loading: The dataset is read using pandas.

Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preparation steps are applied to ensure consistency.

Feature Engineering: Key features are extracted and transformed into a format suitable for analysis.

Modeling: The system uses cosine similarity to compute and rank movie recommendations.

Visualization: Insights are presented using visual tools like seaborn and matplotlib.

Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

seaborn

matplotlib

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendation-System.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Movie-Recommendation-System

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Movie\ Recommendation\ System.ipynb

Run the notebook cells sequentially to build and test the recommendation system.

Example Output

After running the notebook, the system will display movie recommendations based on the input preferences or metadata.

Sample Output:

Input Movie: Inception
Recommended Movies:
1. The Matrix
2. Interstellar
3. Shutter Island
4. The Dark Knight
5. Memento

Visualization plots will provide insights into the dataset and the recommendation process, such as genre distributions or similarity metrics.
