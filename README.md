# Movie-Recommendation-System

## Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict and suggest movies to users based on their preferences and metadata from a dataset. This system leverages similarity measures to provide personalized recommendations, ensuring an enhanced user experience.

## Features
- Suggests movies based on user preferences.
- Analyzes movie metadata to identify patterns and similarities.
- Utilizes popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning.
- Visualizes data insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Dataset
This project uses the `Movies Recommendation.csv` dataset. The dataset contains metadata about movies, including information like titles, genres, and other relevant features.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: 
   - The dataset is read using pandas.
   - Ensures the data is correctly loaded for further processing.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing or inconsistent data.
   - Formats data to make it suitable for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracts critical attributes like genres, keywords, or actors.
   - Transforms text data into numerical features using vectorization techniques like CountVectorizer.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Computes cosine similarity scores to find movies similar to a given input.
   - Sorts and ranks movies based on similarity scores to generate recommendations.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Generates plots to showcase genre distributions or similarity relationships.
   - Provides insights into recommendation logic through graphical representations.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Movie-Recommendation-System
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Movie\ Recommendation\ System.ipynb
Run the notebook cells sequentially:
Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Preprocess the data to handle missing values or irrelevant columns.
Engineer features like keywords, genres, and metadata for modeling.
Apply the cosine similarity algorithm to find similar movies.
Visualize results and analyze the output.
Example Output
After running the notebook, the system will display movie recommendations based on the input preferences or metadata.

Sample Output:

markdown
Copy code
Input Movie: Inception
Recommended Movies:
1. The Matrix
2. Interstellar
3. Shutter Island
4. The Dark Knight
5. Memento
Visualization plots will provide insights into the dataset and the recommendation process, such as genre distributions or similarity metrics.
